# Task 4: Simple Network Packet Analyzer

This project is a simple network packet analyzer that captures network packets and displays information about each packet, including the source and destination IP addresses and protocol type (TCP, UDP, or IP).

## Features
- Captures a limited number of packets in real-time (default is 15).
- Displays protocol type, source IP, and destination IP for each packet.
- Lightweight and easy to use for basic network packet inspection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scapy library (`pip install scapy`)

## Note
This tool is for educational and testing purposes only. Do not use it on networks without authorization.

## Usage
To start the packet capture, run the following command:
```bash
python https://github.com/manilreddy1/StartHere_CS_04.git
